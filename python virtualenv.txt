1. Creating a Virtual Environment:

To create a virtual environment, you can use the venv module (Python 3.3 and later) or virtualenv (a third-party package).

Using venv (Python 3.3+):
python -m venv myenv

2. Activating a Virtual Environment:

On Windows (with VSCode Terminal):
myenv\Scripts\activate

3. Installing Packages:

Once the virtual environment is activated, you can use pip to install packages, and they will be isolated to that environment. For example:
pip install package_name

4. Deactivating the Virtual Environment:

To deactivate the virtual environment and return to the system-wide Python environment, simply run the following command:
deactivate
